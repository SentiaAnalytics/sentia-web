With our business intelligence solution you have the tools to identify these dissatisfied customers and turn them into happy, paying customers. Our software allows you to analyse the layout and placement of individual goods in your store and how that impacts customer's behaviour.

We connect with your cashier system to link purchases to particular demographics, and provides you with a web-based dashboard displaying actionable metrics for your store, such as the current number of customers, the average queue time and the gender and age distributions.
